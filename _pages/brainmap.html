<p>This page accompanies our <em>Trends in Neuroscience</em>
  <a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30071-1" target="_blank">review</a> on the evidence for working memory-related activity across
  different regions of the brain. To gain a birdâ€™s-eye perspective on the
  state of the research, we generated a database of electrophysiological
  working memory studies involving tasks that incorporate a delay period
  between a stimulus and a response. We then determined the cortical areas
  examined in each study and whether the authors positively or negatively
  reported activity that encoded memory for locations, features, or objects.

<p>
  The bar plot on the right displays the
  <span style="color: red">positive</span> and <span style="color: rgb(0,176,240)">negative</span>
  reports of working memory-related activity in different macaque
  brain regions. The criterion defining a positive report was the presence
  of delay activity during a working memory task, while the criterion for a
  negative report was the absence of delay activity (i.e. a negative result).

  The data from the bar plot are projected on to an inflated map of the
  macaque cortex on the left. Each region is color-coded according to the
  number of studies positively or negatively reporting working
  memory-related activity. Note the tendency toward more negative reports in
  early sensory cortices, and more positive reports in association cortices.
  Also note that the color map is scaled by the largest total number of
  studies in any single area. Inflated macaque cortical map courtesy of
