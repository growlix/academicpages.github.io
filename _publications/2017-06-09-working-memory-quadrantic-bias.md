<i>Accessible abstract:</i> Working memory (WM), the temporary (milliseconds to seconds) maintenance and manipulation of information no longer available to the senses, is strongly correlated with measures of intelligence, and a critical foundation for complex behaviors. Psychophysical studies have shown that the horizontal and vertical meridians of the visual field can bias spatial information maintained in WM; remembered locations systematically drift away from the meridians. The lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) is known to encode WM representations of visual space, but previous experiments were not structured in a way that could examine the effects of meridians.<br><br>We found that when storing visual information in working memory, the contents of working memory are not a veridical representation of the external world. Instead, <b>visual space during memory is divided into four quadrants</b>, an effect we see both in neurons and in subjectsâ€™ behavior. Our results provide an explanation for known WM biases, and imply that what we remember, even moments after having seen it, has been transformed from what was really there.
