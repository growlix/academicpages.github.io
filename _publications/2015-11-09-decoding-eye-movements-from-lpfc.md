prefrontal cortex neural ensembles"

excerpt: "Controlling a robot arm with one’s brain activity is no longer a sci-fi pipedream thanks to advances in neural prosthetic research. Most neural prosthetics decode signals from motor cortex and convert them into commands for effectors such as robot arms and computer cursors. Signals in motor cortex are effector-specific and immediate; “move your arm like this, right now”. The ability to decode intended goals in a more abstract form, prior to movement initiation could yield a uniquely powerful and flexible kind of neural prosthetic. Neurons in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) encode signals for goal-directed actions, thus the LPFC might be a good signal source for such a goal-selection brain-computer interface (BCI). As a first step in the development of a goal-selection BCI, we set out to determine if we could decode simple behavioral intentions to direct gaze to different locations in space from LPFC neural activity. We compared a number of different decoding algorithms, and found that is indeed possible to decode intended saccade target location from single-trial LPFC activity. This suggests that the LPFC is a suitable region for a goal-selection cognitive BCI."
