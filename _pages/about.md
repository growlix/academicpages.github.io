I study the neurobiology of cognition.

Recent technological advances have made it possible to record from large numbers of neurons simultaneously. This presents novel opportunities to understand how networks of neurons coordinate to enact complex behavior. It also presents novel challenges in analyzing complex, high-dimensional data. I earned my PhD in the lab of [Dr. Julio Martinez-Trujillo](http://martinezlab.robarts.ca/), studying how networks of neurons underlie behaviors such as [working memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory), [visual attention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention), and rule-learning. A friend once described my work as "translating weak electrical discharges in the brain into strong scientific statements about the mind".

My research has led to a more general interest in how complex systems and high-dimensional information can be represented intuitively and communicated humanely.
