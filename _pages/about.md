A friend once described my work as "translating weak electrical discharges in the brain into strong scientific statements about the mind". I study the neurobiology of cognition.

One way in which brain function has traditionally been investigated is by [recording the electrical activity of single neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-unit_recording) while a research subject engages in a specific behavior. Recent technological advances have made it possible to record the activity of large numbers of neurons simultaneously. This presents novel opportunities to understand how networks of neurons coordinate to enact complex behavior. It also presents novel challenges in analyzing complex, high-dimensional data. I pursued these opportunities during my PhD in the lab of [Dr. Julio Martinez-Trujillo](http://martinezlab.robarts.ca/), studying how networks of neurons coordinate to give rise to behaviors such as [working memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory), [visual attention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention), and rule-learning.

In the process of finding and learning techniques for complex data analysis (we mostly stole them from the machine learning community) and communicating my research, I have developed a more general interest in how complex systems and high-dimensional information can be [represented humanely](http://worrydream.com/#!/TheHumaneRepresentationOfThoughtTalk) and communicated meaningfully.

My other hobbies include organizing [software engineering conferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_University_Software_Engineering_Conference#CUSEC_2012:_Turing_Complete,_January_19%E2%80%9323,_2012_Montreal,_Quebec), [training](/images/cloe_balancing_rice_cake.jpg) [my](/images/clobertasaurus.jpg) [dog](/images/queenest_bean_of_the_good_girls.jpg), and producing and consuming music and food.
