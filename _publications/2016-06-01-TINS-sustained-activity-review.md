_Accessible abstract:_ Any given behavior likely recruits many parts of the brain. Thus a major challenge in neuroscience is designing experiments that can precisely control for and dissociate the components of a behavior that rely on different neurons or brain regions. The same behavior may be studied in very different ways across different experiments, providing additional challenges when one tries to draw generalizations or integrate across studies. The study of working memory (WM) is certainly not exempt from these challenges.<br><br>Neuronal activity in the absence of stimulus input (i.e. neurons activating once the item to remember disappears) is widely considered to be a neural mechanism for WM. This phenomenon was once thought to be limited to certain regions of cortex, but a number of recent studies have argued that this sustained firing is a ubiquitous property of cortical neurons.<br><br>We investigated the evidence for WM activity across the cortex by conducting a comprehensive review of over 150 studies. **We found robust evidence that prefrontal, parietal, and inferotemporal cortices (typically considered “higher” brain areas) exhibit sustained activity during WM tasks, whereas accounts of WM-related activity in early sensory areas are rare and strongly qualified. We also provide a compelling explanation for why fMRI studies often find the opposite result**.
I created an [interactive brain map](/WM_BrainMap/) to convey the results from our review. We invite researchers to contribute to keeping it timely by notifying us of novel or overlooked studies.
